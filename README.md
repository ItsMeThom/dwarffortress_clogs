# About

This mod adds a recipe to craft wooden shoes (Clogs) at a carpenters workshop. Each log produces two wooden clogs.
Dwarves & Humans can both craft and wear wooden clogs. Clogs are a hard shoe, equivalent to a low boot, but not metal.


Hard wooden shoes like Clogs were commonly used by Miners to protect their feet while toiling underground. Also has the added benefit of letting you show visiting representatives what you think of their demands to stop felling trees.


Combine with Windmills and canals for the true Dutch experiences.
